    <h2>Nablus</h2>

    <p>Nablus is very much the nerve centre of the upper West Bank.<br/>
         This beautiful, ancient city – known as the uncrowned Queen of Palestine – 
         is heaving with life, but not yet with tourism.<br/> Its most famous exports are olive oil, 
         soap, cotton and carob.</p>
